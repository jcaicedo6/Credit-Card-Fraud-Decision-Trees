# Credit-Card-Fraud-Decision-Trees

The aim of this project is construct a predective model to detect fraud in a database for credit card clients. For this, the project is divided in the following steps

    In the first part we done a exploration data and we detected the null values in data
    The next sections are divided to answer the next questions
        Question 1:
    ** Histograms of the differents variables for all the customers.
    ** Report any structure you find and any hypotheses you have about that structure.
    ** Report mean and median balance, grouped by year and month of activated_date.
        Question 2:
    ** Report in a table the following information for customers who activated their account and made their last payment during 2020: cust_id (excluding letters), activated_date (in format YYYY-MM), last_payment_date (in format YYYY-MM-DD), cash_advance, credit_limit, and a calculated field of cash_advance as a percentage of credit_limit.
        Question 3:
    ** Build a predictive model for fraud.
    ** What explanatory variable was the most powerful predictor for fraud?
